# nft-blend

This is a hackathon project and is not a part of the minted platfrom.

This project attempts to create a matching protocol, given two users wallet we compute a compatability score between the 2 users based on the types of NFTs, the users have, the dapps thay have interacted with and a couple of other parameters. The idea is to build a fun platform to create more engagement for CDC users.
